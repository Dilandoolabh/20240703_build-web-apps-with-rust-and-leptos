 {"title":"Kaiser Permanente's Secret to Finding Coverage in Your Revenue Cycle","description":"As layoffs and furloughs grow amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of self-pay patients will continue to rise, along with the number of patients applying for charity support. And regardless of their ability to pay, if patients are wrongly classified as uninsured or as having only one insurance option, providers will lose revenue.\n\nDuring this virtual presentation, learn about Kaiser Permanente’s strategy to automate revenue cycle processes upstream and identify patients' billable commercial insurances that may have been unknown or forgotten. This flags accounts that may have been destined as a write-off or charity and maximizes reimbursement revenue resulting in fewer accounts routing to bad-debt collections. Additionally, providers can automate the self-pay scrubbing process. Original Live Webinar Date: March 9, 2021 \n\n","viewing_time":"As layoffs and furloughs grow amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of self-pay patients will continue to rise, along with the number of patients applying for charity support. And regardless of their ability to pay, if patients are wrongly classified as uninsured or as having only one insurance option, providers will lose revenue.\n\nDuring this virtual presentation, learn about Kaiser Permanente’s strategy to automate revenue cycle processes upstream and identify patients' billable commercial insurances that may have been unknown or forgotten. This flags accounts that may have been destined as a write-off or charity and maximizes reimbursement revenue resulting in fewer accounts routing to bad-debt collections. Additionally, providers can automate the self-pay scrubbing process.
